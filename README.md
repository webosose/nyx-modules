nyx-modules
===========

Summary
-------
Open webOS portability layer - device specific modules

Description
-----------

The nyx-modules repository is a collection of device specific modules for supporting different functionalities like charging, display, keypad, touchscreen. Currently it supports the emulator versions (qemux86 and qemuarm). However it is extensible in design to add modules for any new device.

How to Build on Linux
=====================

## Dependencies

Below are the tools and libraries (and their minimum versions) required to build nyx-modules:

* cmake (version required by cmake-modules-webos)
* cmake-modules-webos 1.0.0 RC4
* gcc 4.6.3
* glib-2.0 2.32.1
* make (any version)
* nyx-lib 7.3.0
* pkg-config 0.26
* pmloglib 3.3.0

Below is the component (and its minimum version) required to run nyx-modules:
* lsb 4.1

## Building

Once you have downloaded the source, enter the following to build it (after
changing into the directory under which it was downloaded):

    $ mkdir BUILD
    $ cd BUILD
    $ cmake -DNYX_MODULES_REQUIRED="NYXMOD_OW_DISPLAY" ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The directory under which the files are installed defaults to `/usr/local/webos`.
You can install them elsewhere by supplying a value for `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`
when invoking `cmake`. You'll also need to tell cmake which Nyx modules to build
by supplying a semicolon-separated value for `NYX_MODULES_REQUIRED`. For example:

    $ cmake -D WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT:PATH=$HOME/projects/webosose -DNYX_MODULES_REQUIRED="NYXMOD_OW_DISPLAY;NYXMOD_OW_DEVICEINFO;NYXMOD_OW_OSINFO" ..
    $ make
    $ make install

will install the files in subdirectories of `$HOME/projects/webosose`.

Specifying `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` also causes `pkg-config` to look in that tree
first before searching the standard locations. You can specify additional
directories to be searched prior to this one by setting the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`
environment variable.

If not specified, `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` defaults to `/usr/local/webos`.

To configure for a debug build, enter:

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..

To see a list of the make targets that `cmake` has generated, enter:

    $ make help

## Uninstalling

From the directory where you originally ran `make install`, enter:

 $ [sudo] make uninstall

You will need to use `sudo` if you did not specify `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`.
